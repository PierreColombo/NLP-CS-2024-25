# Paper Presentation Guidelines

Welcome to the Advance NLP Class for CS student. This is time for you to read the rules of the Paper Presentation! Your presentation will be a large part of your final grade, constituting 50% of it. To ensure you excel, here are the guidelines:

## Presentation Duration

- **Time Limit:** You have a tight window of 10 minutes to present your papers. Succinctness is key, so focus on the essentials and maintain a pedagogical approach throughout.

## Grading Criteria

Your presentation will be graded based on the following criteria:

1. **Clarity/Pedagogy (out of 10):** How clearly you convey the material and how effectively you teach the concepts.
   
2. **Correctness (out of 10):** The accuracy and precision of your understanding and explanation of the paper's content.

3. **Bonus (+2):** If your presentation slides are exceptionally well-crafted and enhance the understanding of the material.

4. **Malus (-1):** When you go over the allocated time, you'll incur a penalty of -1.
