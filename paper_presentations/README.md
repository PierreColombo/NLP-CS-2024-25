# Paper Presentation Guidelines

Welcome to the Advance NLP Class for CS student. This is time for you to read the rules of the Paper Presentation! Your presentation will be a large part of your final grade, constituting 50% of it. To ensure you excel, here are the guidelines:

## Presentation Duration

- **Time Limit:** You have a tight window of 10 minutes to present your papers. Succinctness is key, so focus on the essentials and maintain a pedagogical approach throughout.

## Grading Criteria

Your presentation will be graded based on the following criteria:

1. **Clarity/Pedagogy (out of 10):** How clearly you convey the material and how effectively you teach the concepts.
   
2. **Correctness (out of 10):** The accuracy and precision of your understanding and explanation of the paper's content.

3. **Bonus (+2):** If your presentation slides are exceptionally well-crafted and enhance the understanding of the material.

4. **Malus (-1):** When you go over the allocated time, you'll incur a penalty of -1.

## What you need to do?

### Register

Choose by group of N/5 the paper you would like to present by registering before the next class 12:00 PM and register on the [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rLJqLCXdfX8nDUdNelRM5KHrY1EwUZI4sMWssfZGabU/edit?usp=sharing)

### The sonday before the presentation:

Send me your presentation before 8 PM and update the link of the presentation in the Google Sheet.

Hello everyone,
I hope you're doing well. I have noticed that very few presentations are being submitted on time, even though the deadline remains set for the Sunday before the presentation at 8 PM. Meeting this deadline is essential to allow us to work efficiently together and iterate on your work.

To encourage better organization and emphasize the importance of this deadline, I propose the following adjustments to the rules:

Any presentation submitted late will receive a score of 0.
Regarding the second part of the Kaggle project, I will consider it optional, as the presentation accounts for 50% of the final grade.
For the resit, students concerned will be required to answer three theoretical questions related to the course.

I am counting on your seriousness and commitment to adhere to these guidelines. If you have any questions or difficulties, please don't hesitate to reach out to me promptly.

Best regards,
## Let's goooo! 

Make sure to thoroughly prepare and deliver your presentation. Good luck!
